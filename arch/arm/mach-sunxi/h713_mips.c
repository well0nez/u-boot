 *  7. CPU_COMM initialization entered
 *  8. application byte-pool creation succeeded
 *  9. share-register reader called

 * 10. reset code handed off to the C runtime
 * 11-14. successive pre-application initialization calls entered
 * 15. application/thread construction entered
 * 16. ThreadX scheduler entry called
 *
 * Markers 17-26 cover every direct call in application/thread construction;
 * marker 26 is the ThreadX thread-creation call whose entry argument is the
 * application function traced by marker 6.
 * Marker 21's extended cave also records the sys:dbg_buf address and size

 * 0x8b110478: the global enable write, InitTFDMemory virtual call,
 * tse_init_data, and its two fatal-log paths.
 *
 * Markers 62-66 cover setCPUReady(), its spinlock acquire/unlock calls, and
 * its return to InitCommMem. Markers 67-71 cover the five calls after
 * InitCommMem returns and before setCPUAppReady(). Marker 72 enters the first
 * registration group. Markers 73-77 trace its CPU_COMM request through call-
 * table insertion, result lookup, and the insertion spinlock. Markers 78-82

/*
 * CPU_COMM RETURN progress trace for the authenticated 4380f1b3... image.
 *
 * Each trampoline writes a progress-stage value to the uncached shared-memory
 * alias and then preserves the displaced control flow.
 * The normal startup trace uses the same code caves, so the two modes are
 * deliberately mutually exclusive.
 *
 *   a001  worker entered FreeCall recycling
 *   a002  release semaphore acquired; pre-commit log entered
 *   a003  pre-commit log returned; requesting FIFO write slot
 *   a004  committing the recycled slot to FreeCall
 *   a005  posting the release semaphore
 *   a105  release-semaphore post returned an error
 *   a006  release-semaphore post succeeded
 *   a007  final release log entered
 *   b001  routine lookup entered
 *   b002  routine lookup returned
 *   b003  handler arguments prepared; pre-call log entered
 *   b004  component handler entered
 *   c001  component handler returned to the worker
 *   c002  worker called SendComm2CPUEx
 *   c003  SendComm2CPUEx entered the send-semaphore wait
 *   c103  send-semaphore wait returned an error
 *   c004  send semaphore acquired
 *   c005  receiver staging-FIFO space is being checked
 *   c006  receiver staging FIFO has space
 *   c007  FreeReturn allocation entered
 *   c008  RETURN publication entered
 *   c009  waiting for RETURN_ACK
 *   d001  RETURN_ACK interrupt queued its deferred action
 *   d005  queueAction returned to the RETURN_ACK interrupt handler
 *   d002  deferred RETURN_ACK action reached the wakeup path
 *   d003  deferred action is posting the sender wait semaphore
 *   d103  sender wait-semaphore post returned an error
 *   d004  sender wait-semaphore post succeeded
 *   c010  SendComm2CPUEx resumed after RETURN_ACK
 *   c011  SendComm2CPUEx is releasing its send semaphore
 *   c111  send-semaphore release returned an error
 *   c012  send semaphore released successfully
 *   c013  SendComm2CPUEx returned to the CALL worker
 *
 * A separate CALL-action stage at trace+0x0c avoids races with the worker and
 * ACK stages above. trace+0x08 records osa_queue_send's unmodified return.
 *
 *   e001  CALL interrupt is invoking queueAction
 *   e004  queueAction returned to the CALL interrupt handler
 *   e005  CALL HISR wrapper is invoking the dispatcher
 *   e006  command_action entered for CALL
 *   e007  command_action is enqueueing the high-priority CALL worker
 *   e008  command_action is sending CALL_ACK
 *   e009  SendAckLow returned
 *   e010  command_action is returning to the CALL HISR wrapper
 *   e011  CALL HISR dispatcher returned
 *
 * A third persistent stage at trace+0x10 proves that the first RETURN_ACK
 * callback and its HISR wrapper actually returned to the shared consumer:
 *
 *   f001  ack_action is returning to the RETURN_ACK HISR wrapper
 *   f002  RETURN_ACK HISR dispatcher returned
 *   f003  RETURN_ACK HISR wrapper is returning
 *
 * The final three trampolines follow THal_Vp_SetSource below CPU_COMM. They
 * publish through the same uncached alias because the stock source globals
 * live in cached MIPS KSEG0 and therefore cannot be inspected reliably from
 * ARM with fwmd:
 *
 *   5101  source callback received an event
 *   5102  source callback returned from its nonblocking queue send
 *   5201  source worker dequeued a source-change event
 *   5202  source worker found new source equal to its current source
 *   5203  source worker completed the source transition
 *
 * THal_Vp_Init's registered adapter gets one more persistent slot.  Its
 * three stock inputs are [0, 1, physical address of a 0xd800-byte buffer].
 * These markers distinguish an internal initializer failure from a bad bulk
 * destination or the callback-install tail without changing any arguments:
 *
 *   7101  adapter entered; calling the local state reset
 *   7102  local state reset returned; calling the VP initializer
 *   7103  VP initializer returned; loading the caller's physical buffer
 *   7104  0xd800-byte copy returned
 *   7105  output prepared; entering callback installation

 * Rx_HDCP14_LoadKey polls HDMI-RX 0x06840093 and gives up after 0x33 ticks.

 * the firmware is built to survive becomes a hang. Rewriting the loop bound to
 * zero makes the wait give up on its first pass, taking the same path a real
 * timeout would. Applied after the hash check, so the image is authenticated
 * before it is modified.
 *
 * The address is firmware-specific: the same loop sits at 0x4b13d0a4 in the
 * revision found in an earlier captured dump and at 0x4b13d6f8 in the image
 * this board actually carries.
 *
 * One constant per revision does not reach past the boards we own. A third
 * device cannot be helped until someone with that device reads the address
 * out, and reading it out needs the very command the missing address blocks.
 * So find the site in the image instead. The instruction is "sltiu v1,v1,0x33"
 * (0x2c630033), and on this board's image it occurs twice -- once in
 * Rx_HDCP14_LoadKey, once in an unrelated function. Context tells them apart:
 * only the real site has the polled register 0x06840093 built nearby, as the
 * halves a MIPS lui/ori pair leaves in the instruction stream. Measured on
 * display.bin 16c74a28...: the hit at 0x4b13d0a4 has both halves within 1 KiB,

 *
 * The record semantics below are read off the vendor applier itself, at
 * 0x4a025164 in this board's stock U-Boot 2018.05 (Thumb-2, load base
 * 0x4a000000). It walks a {?, records, count} descriptor and switches on the
 * type word at +0xc:
 *
 *   type <= 4    masked read-modify-write: *addr = (*addr & ~mask) | value.
 *                Stock uses a 32-bit access for every type in that range --
 *                the width field is vestigial, and this container only ever
 *                uses 4 anyway.
 *   type 0xfe    pulse the masked bits: *addr = cur & ~mask, then
 *                *addr = cur | mask, where cur is one read taken up front.
 *                The value word is not used.
 *   type 0xff    delay, in MICROSECONDS -- it calls the udelay thunk at
 *                0x4a000d74, and the delay core busy-waits val * 24 arch-timer
 *                ticks at 24 MHz. The separate x1000 mdelay wrapper next to it
 *                is not what the walker uses.
 *
 * The container holds several alternative tables -- a CCU/TVTOP prologue, a
 * set of timing blocks, and seven DE/mixer/LVDS blocks for different modes --
 * and which combination this panel needs is not yet established. So this
 * command applies an explicit byte range rather than trying to pick for you;

 * port was installed on there is no vendor FAT at all (doku/109).
 *
 * So ask for the partition by name, the way stock does, and let the GPT say

 *
 *   bootloader_a / bootloader_b  stock, per the slot in misc

 * are the ones stock itself would read. The environment overrides all of it
 * (h713_mips_dev), and our own boot script sets it, so on an installed HY310
 * none of this runs.
 *
 * The result is cached: part_get_info_by_name() walks the GPT entry by entry,

 *
 * The likely reason a second run fails is right here in the GPIOs. The bring-up

 * Ordering is the general LVDS rule -- backlight off, then signal, then VCC --
 * because it is the one part of this with real hardware risk. Panels can latch
 * up when the data lanes outlive the rail, and repeated violations shorten
 * their life.
 *
 * Two deliberate omissions:
 *
 *   - The backlight is not touched. Which PWM drives it is still unresolved:
 *     display_cfg.xml says channel 0, panel_config.ini says channel 5, and the
 *     dimmer we implemented drives PWM2 on PB4, which matches neither. Turning
 *     off the wrong channel would be theatre.
 *
 *   - The display PLLs and mod clocks are left running. Disabling a block's
 *     clock while something still reaches for it is the documented way to wedge
 *     this interconnect, and the acceptance test does not need it: the bring-up
 *     replays LogoRegData, which rewrites this state absolutely. Leaving them
 *     up is the conservative choice, not an oversight.
 *
 * The firmware cannot do any of this for us. THal_Vp_Deinit was tested on

 *
 *   - patch 0007 calls 0x040 dead-zone control and 0x060 ENABLE. Under this
 *     map 0x040 is the per-channel CLK_GATE and 0x080 is ENABLE. After the

 *     counter was not running. Under patch 0007's map every field was set
 *     correctly and the counter should have been counting. It was not.
 *   - patch 0007 puts CLK_CFG SRC at [1:0], DIV_M at [6:4] and a gate at bit
 *     7. Here SRC is [8:7] and DIV_M is [3:0], which is exactly the 0x18f

 * at ~100% duty under *either* field order. It is a degenerate sample and must
 * not be cited as proof of the layout again.

 * Modulate the light's supply enable on PB5 by hand.

 * PB5 has no PWM function in this SoC's pinmux -- gpio_in/gpio_out only -- so
 * toggling is the only way to modulate it. That is worth doing because the
 * light is not fed a raw rail: the LED header measures 52.6 V against a 36 V
 * input, so a boost converter sits between them, and PWM-on-enable is a
 * standard dimming technique for LED boost drivers. If this converter honours
 * it, brightness control needs no new hardware at all.
 *
 * Shell loops cannot test this. A recursive "run" gives a duty set by command
 * dispatch time (roughly 90% on) at an uncontrolled frequency, which is why
 * bit-banging from the prompt showed nothing.
 *
 * Bounded by construction: it runs for a fixed time and always restores PB5
 * high on exit. Ctrl-C aborts a command, not a loop, so a U-Boot experiment
 * that cannot end by itself is one power cycle away from being a nuisance.
 *
 * PB5 is shared with fan power. Low duty slows the fan, so prefer short runs
 * and start high; the light being off for the same period makes this thermally
 * safe, but a stalled fan is still worth avoiding.

 *
 * That is as far as the quadrants go. The visible stripe period is ~38 display
 * rows, far too coarse for a per-row effect, and at 1.8 display rows per photo
 * pixel the capture is almost certainly showing moire rather than the true
 * period. No stride ratio can honestly be read off it.
 *
 * These bands vary only ACROSS the frame, isolating the axis fb-vprobe could
 * not test. 160 px each, wide enough to survive blur:
 *
 *   eight vertical bands, correct order   horizontal addressing is fine, and the
 *                                         quad failure is an interaction effect
 *   horizontal stripes instead            the axes are transposed or interleaved
 *   more than eight bands                 the line is repeating; the count gives
 *                                         the true pitch as a ratio, which is the

 *   eight bands, wrong order              the line is being read out permuted
 *
 * Note the left/right column artefact is not this bug. It appears in the TCON

 * Four solid quadrants. The blur-proof geometry test.

 * period. A pattern is only as good as the photograph it has to survive.
 *
 * So: four quadrants, each a solid 640x360 block. Red top-left, green
 * top-right, blue bottom-left, yellow bottom-right. Nothing else. These stay
 * legible through blur, defocus and keystone, and the colour sequence encodes

 *   quadrants present but transposed   flip, mirror or rotation

 * A framebuffer pattern that cannot hide an addressing error on either axis.

 * They do not. Every row of a band is uniform across the full width, so a
 * horizontal stride error leaves the bands looking perfectly correct -- the same
 * structural blindness as scoring a checkerboard with a column-only metric, or
 * judging a logo by a row-luminance profile. Three instruments in this
 * investigation have now reported on an axis they could not see.
 *
 * The vendor logo shows what the bands missed: a 545x36 text block centred at
 * (368,343), verified byte-exact in the framebuffer by fbcheck, projects as a
 * streak spanning nearly the full width and only a few rows tall.
 *
 * This pattern is sensitive to everything the bands were not:
 *
 *   2 px white border      any scale or crop error moves or loses an edge
 *   both diagonals         a stride error changes their slope; they are the
 *                          single most sensitive feature to row pitch
 *   centre crosshair       shows translation
 *   corner squares         red TL, green TR, blue BL, yellow BR -- names any
 *                          flip, rotation or mirror unambiguously
 *   1 px grid every 128    a repeating reference for measuring scale directly
 *
 * Diagonals matter most. If the hardware reads with a row pitch different from
 * the 5120 bytes written, a corner-to-corner diagonal comes back at a visibly

 * It crosses the full width once every P/|D| rows, so a 720-row frame shows
 *
 *	N = 720*|D| / P
 *
 * diagonal red/blue stripes, and inverting that gives the answer from any step:
 *
 *	|P_hw - P| = N * P / 720,  about 1.64 px per stripe at these pitches.
 *
 * That is the real scoring rule, and it is much stronger than "look for the
 * vertical one": every step measures the pitch independently, and the six must
 * agree. Expect a single edge only from a step within ~1.6 px of the truth --
 * with 4 px steps at most one can be, and the rest will show 2, 3, 5, 8 stripes
 * rather than the one boundary an earlier note here promised. Do not read a
 * multi-stripe step as a failed step or as moire; it is the measurement.
 *

 * Sweep the display PLL and watch for the checker to resolve.

 * the free-running counter -2.28% against a predicted -2.326% -- so the PLL runs
 * at 24 MHz * (N+1) = 1032 MHz and the counter is PLL/56.
 *
 * It did not settle the ratio between the PLL and DCLK, and cannot: the two
 * fields the panel config writes into 0x058c0024 both left the counter flat,
 * which is what a divider downstream of the counter's tap point looks like. So
 * DCLK is 1032/14 = 73.7, 1032/7 = 147.4, or 18.4 MHz, and no measurement
 * available here distinguishes them.
 *
 * Searching is cheaper than deducing. The chroma checker now reproduces across
 * boots -- test_17, test_18 and test_19 all separated the solids cleanly -- so
 * it is a usable instrument, and the PLL is a verified knob. Step N across a
 * range that brackets 62 MHz under the 1032/14 reading, show the red/blue
 * checker at each step, and look for cells to appear.
 *
 * N+1 from 32 to 52 keeps the PLL between 768 and 1248 MHz, near its working
 * point, which is deliberately a narrower range than the retune that hung the
 * board. Under the /14 reading that spans 54.9 to 89.1 MHz of DCLK and brackets
 * the panel's 62. If the checker resolves at any step, that step's N gives both
 * the right DCLK and the ratio; if none does, the /14 reading is wrong and the
 * remaining two candidates need a different approach.
 *
 * Each step verifies itself: the counter must track N proportionally, and a
 * step where it does not is reported and its visual result disclaimed.

 * rewrites the TCON timing to 1080p, and 0x05600168 -- written 0x000003b2 by
 * DE block 5 -- reads back zero once it has run. Re-imposing the TCON timing
 * post-readiness is already known to stick (h713_disp_latch_panel_timing), so
 * the OSD path gets the same treatment: replay the block, which re-asserts
 * AFBD's format, size, stride, buffer address and enable bit together with the
 * mixer and DE registers the same block owns.
 *
 * The block is replayed rather than hand-written so it applies exactly what
 * the records say, including the panel-config patches already made to them.
 * DE block 5 touches only 0x0560xxxx, 0x0525cxxx, 0x0524cxxx and 0x05280xxx,
 * so it cannot disturb the TCON timing latched just before it.
 *
 * This is a diagnostic. If the OSD appears only after the re-assert, the
 * firmware owns the fetch path and the real work is in how ownership is handed
 * over -- not in another framebuffer pattern.

/*
 * Send one CPU_COMM CALL and poll for its reply.
 *
 * Every step below is transcribed from display.bin rather than inferred:
 *
 *   queue      0x8b1195ec/0x8b1195b8 are mirrors of the share_seq addressing,
 *              so a message from X to Y lives in share_seq(Y, X, idx). For
 *              ARM(0) -> MIPS(1) CALL that is share_seq(1,0,0), and the reply
 *              comes back in share_seq(0,1,1).
 *   allocate   0x8b118be8 takes share_seq+0x78 and pops via 0x8b1180ec, which
 *              returns base_addr + rd_idx*item_size and NULL when rd == wr.
 *              The popped entry holds the slot's ARM-physical address, and the
 *              slot carries its own index at +0x04, bounds-checked below 20.
 *   fill       memcpy(slot, msg, 104) at 0x8b1201b8, then slot[+0x04] = index
 *              and slot[+0x0A] = 2, then an assertion that the slot address is
 *              exactly share_seq + 0x168 + 104*index.
 *   publish    0x8b11f9ec writes share_seq[+0x10] = index, [+0x08] = flags,
 *              [+0x14] = session, [+0x18] = wait pointer, bumps [+0x04].
 *              The call site at 0x8b12046c sources the state byte from
 *              msg[+0x06] & 0xff, so the flags halfword is what lands there.
 *   doorbell   a single write to 0x03003874; the pulse workaround in the Linux
 *              tree belongs to the ARISC path, not this one.
 *
 * The doorbell word is the message type and nothing else. The msgbox LISR at
 * 0x8b121698 drains the port-1 FIFO and calls the registered channel callback
 * with the raw word in $a0; that callback (0x8b121d78) forwards it verbatim to
 * cpu_comm_cb at 0x8b122678 with $a1 hardcoded to zero. cpu_comm_cb switches
 * on the whole 32-bit value:
 *
 *      0 -> 0x8b11f0a4  CALL          2 -> 0x8b11f61c  CALL_ACK
 *      1 -> 0x8b11f360  RETURN        3 -> 0x8b11f804  RETURN_ACK
 *
 * and silently drops anything else. Each handler then calls queueAction with
 * the matching index, which activates HISR[cpu][index] -- the four records
 * named "%s CALL HISR" .. "%s RETURN_ACK HISR" that Trid_CPUComm_Init builds
 * at 0x8b1221e0. So a CALL is doorbell 0x00000000. There is no msg_type<<16
 * field and no intr_type field; the Linux tree's packing is not what this
 * firmware parses.
 *
 * The presence gate is share_seq[+0x08] bit 2. comm_handle_call resolves
 * share_seq(1,0,0) at 0x8b11f18c, tests that bit at 0x8b11f19c, and returns
 * immediately when it is clear -- which is every send this project has made.
 * When it is set the handler clears it (0x8b11f2ec) and queues the HISR, so
 * the bit going 4 -> 0 in shared memory is the on-hardware proof of receipt.
 *
 * Note the ordering hazard this implies: once bit 2 is set, share_seq[+0x10]
 * must hold a slot index below 20, or the assert at 0x8b11f24c spins the
 * firmware forever. The empty marker written by init is exactly 20, so the
 * flag must never be raised without a matching published index.
 *
 * The wait pointer is published as zero deliberately. The receiver stores it
 * at share_seq[+0x70]/[+0x74] without dereferencing, and the signal primitive
 * at 0x8b15c27c null-checks and returns an error rather than writing. U-Boot
 * polls, so it does not need to be signalled. The residual risk is behavioural
 * -- the firmware may log an error path -- not memory corruption.
 *
 * This is the first traffic in either direction. It writes into a live
 * coprocessor's queues, so it is a separate opt-in command and never runs as
 * part of panel-test.
